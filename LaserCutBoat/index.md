This is a boat I built with my daughter Élise when she was nine for
Mom's birthday. Élise did the artwork and designed the model on paper,
including ruler and compass construction. I scanned the artwork and
reproduced the construction in the svg file. Once laser printed on an
A4 2.5mm heavy cardboard (the bottom of a strawberry case!), she did
the gluing and rigging (sails, ...).
