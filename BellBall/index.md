The professional juggler [Vincent
Delaven√®re](http://www.vincentdelavenere.com/) has been exploring over
the last decade various ways to build musical juggling balls. This
ball we designed with him is 3D printed and unscrews into two half
spheres into which a bell can be fitted.

## Printing Notes

Load the stl model in [cura](http://wiki.ultimaker.com/Cura), split it
into two pieces, rotate if needed the pieces so that they lays flat on
their outer rim.
