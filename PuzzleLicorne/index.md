This puzzle was designed by my daughter as a gift for her sister.

The unicorn was drawn on paper, scanned, imported into inkscape, and
vectorized by hand (for a simple picture like this one, this takes a
dozen minutes and is the occasion to improve the model; so at the end
it's quicker than using Inkscape's automatic vectorization together
with the necessary posttreatment to get the same result). The text and
frame was then added in Inkscape.
